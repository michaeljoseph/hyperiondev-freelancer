## Section A: Code Review (Python)

### Correctness

I'm not sure if you attempted to test or execute your solution, but when I tried I got the following error message:

```bash
üïô 2022-12-08 10:48:47  ‚ùØ python anagram.py
  File "/Users/michaeljoseph/Source/hyperiondev-freelancer/anagram.py", line 3
    result = {}
               ^
IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level
```

Python is a whitespace sensitive language, so it's important to make sure that you [indent consistently] throughout your program.

I made the following change on L2 of your code:

```bash
üïô 2022-12-08 14:16:02  ‚ùØ diff anagram.py corrected-anagram.py
2c2
<        def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
---
>    def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
```

Then the following error:

```bash
üïô 2022-12-08 13:40:52  ‚ùØ python anagram.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/michaeljoseph/Source/hyperiondev-freelancer/anagram.py", line 12, in <module>
    print(ob1.groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]))
  File "/Users/michaeljoseph/Source/hyperiondev-freelancer/anagram.py", line 5, in groupAnagrams
    x = "".join(sorted())
TypeError: sorted expected 1 argument, got 0
```

The error message is telling us that the <code>[sorted]</code> function takes one argument, but you didn't provide one in your code (on L5).

Let's presume that you intended to sort the current item `i`  of the list `strs` that you're iterating through:

```diff
üïô 2022-12-08 14:17:42  ‚úñ  diff anagram.py corrected-anagram.py
2c2
<        def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
---
>    def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
5c5
<          x = "".join(sorted(i))
---
>          x = "".join(sorted())
```

Your program now successfully executes with the following output:

```bash
üïô 2022-12-08 14:21:33  ‚úñ  python corrected-anagram.py
[['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']]
```

This is the expected output, so well done! üéâü•≥üëç

The key takeaway should be that you should always execute your solution and try to make sense of the error messages that the interpreter is providing to help you.

### Documentation

Your solution is missing [comments or docstrings], which are useful ways of capturing your thinking and the purpose of your classes, functions and blocks  of code.

### Efficiency

Your implementation is reasonably efficient, since you're only looping through the input list once, which is good news for the [time complexity] of your function.

### Style

The accepted conventions for Python code formatting are documented in [PEP8], so please ensure that your Python solutions conform to these best practice.

## Section A: Code Review (Java)

I've only just read the requirement to have different language selections between Section A and C and since I'd prefer to problem solve in Python, here's a code review of the Java Task as well.

### Correctness
